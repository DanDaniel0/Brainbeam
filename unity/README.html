<h2>Welcome to Unity example app for Libmuse.</h2>
<p>
This example app is a getting started point for developing apps for the muse headband in Unity. 
It uses the Libmuse library for interfacing with Muse headbands, including finding
paired Muses, connecting to them, reading their state, and receiving packets
for raw EEG data and other values.
